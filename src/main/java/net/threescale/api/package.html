<p>This API is used to encapsulate the communication with the 3scale backend server
    for validating and reporting transactions between the user and the provider of
    a service. For the definitive specification of the interface refer to
    <a href="http://www.3scale.net/support/api-service-management-v2-0/">The 3scale Management API specification</a></p>

<h2>Using the API</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You instansiate an API object using a factory.
        This can be done once in your application, or in each transaction.
    </li>
    <li>Send a 'start' to the server containing app_id supplied by the user.</li>
    <li>Perform the transaction.</li>
    <li>Send a 'confirm' for the transaction detailing what resources were used.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to abort the transaction you send a 'cancel' instead of a 'confirm'.</p>

@see net/threescale/api/v2/Example.java For code examples.

<h2>Jar file</h2>

<p>The latest runtime Api is in the distribution tarball in dist/threescale-api.jar.</p>
